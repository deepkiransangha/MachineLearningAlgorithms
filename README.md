This project implements an NLP-based fake news detection system designed to classify news articles as real or fake using textual, sentiment, and statistical features. The system transforms raw article text into TF-IDF embeddings and incorporates sentiment analysis to capture emotional tone, then applies classical machine learning models—including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Means clustering—to learn patterns associated with misinformation. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction to improve model efficiency and interpretability. Model performance is evaluated using cross-validation and confusion matrix analysis, achieving 85%+ classification accuracy. The project also analyzes feature importance to identify linguistic and sentiment signals commonly associated with fake news.
